MapReduce implementation I made to help learn GOLANG. It works, but requires the user to write their code for map and reduce in the code itself, as I didn't implement reading in another program from a file to get the function from there. Right now it just does a reverse index, so if you wanted to use my implementation for some reason, you would have to rewrite that bit if you wanted to use it for something else.
